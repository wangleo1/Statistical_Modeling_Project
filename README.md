# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
 - Analyze the factors impacting the number of available bikes within Quebec bike stations
 - Build a statistical model which explores correlation between the number of free bike at any given bike station and its average distance from local gyms/restaurants

## Process
 1. Gather information on Quebec bike stations through the usage of the Citybikes API
 2. Collect information on restuarants, bars and gyms within a 1km radius of any given bikestation utilizing Foursquare API
 3. Explore, transform and clean data generated from API
 4. Repeat step 2 and 3 utilizing Yelp API 
 5. Compare information recieved from both Foursquare and Yelp APIs
 6. Join information from all prior steps into one cohesive DataFrame
 7. Utilize EDA and data visualization methods to explore data
 8. Create a SQLite database to store information collected
 9. Build a regression models to analyze relationship between number of free bike at a given station and its average distance from a gym
 10. Interperet results and present findings 



## Results
(fill in what you found about the comparative quality of API coverage in your chosen area and the results of your model.)

## Challenges 
Request Constraints on Yelp API 

Yelp outage 

## Future Goals
Explore additional factors impacting the number of gyms and bike stations within a given city

Analyze the consumer basis of CityBikes users
